description: Mr. Burton Crane (the book says he is under 30) rents a house from "one
  of the most aristocratic families south of the Mason and Dixon's", with the understanding
  that it comes complete with servants. The butler seems young for his job but looks
  like he will function very well. The cook is beautiful and cooks like a dream. The
  maid is rather sullen and ungracious. And the 'Useful Boy' is inclined to be impertinent.
  Within a few days Burton moves into his leased home with his lawyer, his almost
  fiancee and her mother. It doesn't take very long for the servants to make life
  difficult for Burton with amusing results. But, boy, can the cook deliver some delicious
  dishes. And she's beautiful, sweet and nice to talk to.
